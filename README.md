# SBG-CGC_course2018

IARC course on analyzing TCGA data in the SevenBridges Genomics CancerGenomicsCloud (SBG-CGC).  

## Description of the course

__Learning objectives__  
After completing this workshop, participants will be able to run their own computational tools on the cloud using TCGA data using:
* the SevenBridges web interface to select and retrieve TCGA data,
* Docker and DockerHub to build and store containers to deploy their own
computational tools,
* the Common Workflow Language (CWL) to describe the pipelines to run,
* the SevenBridges R api to run automatically reproducible analyses.  

__Main topics__
* Introduction to Cloud computing
* Introduction to Docker and DockerHub
* SevenBridges R API and web interface
* TCGA data analysis

## Projects

For each project, we have opened an issue to discuss on, and add a folder to host the code.  

Project 1: needlestack variant calling. [Issue](https://github.com/IARCbioinfo/SBG-CGC_course2018/issues/1). [Code]().

Project 2: neutral tumor evolution. [Issue](https://github.com/IARCbioinfo/SBG-CGC_course2018/issues/2). [Code]().

Project 3: cell populations from RNA-seq. [Issue](https://github.com/IARCbioinfo/SBG-CGC_course2018/issues/3). [Code]().
