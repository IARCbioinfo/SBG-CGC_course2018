## Analyzing TCGA data in the cloud: what you can do in just one day

Participants of the course will discuss their cloud projects during the IARC OMICS discussions on April 6th 2018.

**Duration**: ~5/10 minutes per group.

**Abstract**: During this course we recently organised at IARC, we asked participants to work on their research project during one day using what they just learned. We all recognised how powerful cloud computing can be, and were amazed by what could be achieved in such a short period of time, but we also faced difficulties. We think that knowing what can be accomplished and what the limitations of cloud computing are will be useful to a broader audience. During this presentation, participants will discuss their experience and show how this contributed to their research project for a wide range of applications (quantification of immune contexture, variant calling, mutation signature analysis, tumor evolution etc.).

### Presentation template:

Here is a suggestion for the structure of the presentation. There will be a general introduction about cloud computing before, so you don't need to introduce this in each presentation.

**Name of the project**: give a name to your project

**Description of the project**:
 - Why did you choose this one, what was your interest, in which larger project it integrates? (scientific part)
 - Why do you need the cloud to conduct your project? (technical part)

**How you did it**:
 - Briefly mention the method(s) used (bioinformatics software)
 - List the different steps you performed to implement the analyses in the cloud (getting the data, Docker container, App creation etc.)
  - Comment on the actual state of the project for each step (done, to be done, in progress etc.).
  - Mention the difficulties you have encountered and how you solved them. If you haven't, you can propose something that you will try, or maybe why your project was not appropriate for cloud computing in the end.

**Results**: show a nice biological result you managed to get!

**Conclusion**: discuss pros and cons of cloud computing. There will be a general conclusion about this so mention only things that are particularly relevant for your own project.
